module DeferrableGratification
  module Combinators
    # Combinator that passes the result of one deferred operation to a block
    # that uses that result to begin another deferred operation.  The compound
    # operation itself succeeds if the second operation does.
    #
    # You probably want to call {#bind!} rather than using this class directly.
    #
    # If we define +Deferrable err (IO a)+ to be the type of a Deferrable that
    # may perform a side effect and then either succeed with a value of type a
    # or fail with an error of type err, then we expect the block to have type
    #
    #     a -> Deferrable err (IO b)
    #
    # and if so this combinator (actually {Bind.setup!}) is a specialisation
    # of the monadic bind operator +>>=+:
    #
    #     # example: database query that depends on the result of another
    #     Bind.setup!(DB.query('select foo from bar')) do |result|
    #       DB.query("select baz from quuz where name = '#{result}'")
    #     end
    #
    #     # type signatures, in pseudo-Haskell
    #     (>>=) :: Deferrable err a ->
    #                  (a -> Deferrable err b) -> Deferrable err b
    #     Bind :: Deferrable err a ->
    #                  (a -> Deferrable err (IO b)) -> Deferrable err (IO b)
    #
    # However, because Ruby doesn't actually type-check blocks, we can't
    # enforce that the block really does return a second Deferrable.  This
    # therefore also supports (reasonably) arbitrary blocks.  However, it's
    # probably clearer (though equivalent) to use {#transform} for this case.
